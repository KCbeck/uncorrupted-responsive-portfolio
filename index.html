      <img src="assets/images/kcbeckphoto.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Spending my childhood between Kansas City and various parts of Colorado I moved to Kearney Missouri when I was 12. I worked odd jobs including as a farm hand, a mechanic and washing dishes at the Rockfront Bar and Grill in Holt Missouri.  I joined the Army National Guard when I was 17 and completed Basic Training during the summer of my Junior Year.</p> 
      
      <p>I was part of Trumans Field Artillery Unit in Independence Mo. I tried out for 19th SFG at the Rec. in Watkins Colorado. Despite being asked to join the unit I had no where to stay so I created a play to get released from National Guard and attempted to get on active duty. I recruited for the Wisconsin National Guard for a few months and was released to go Active Army where I inprocessesed at Fort Hood in 2005</p>

      <p>I got injured not long after and spent the next two years trying to stay in the military. Shortly after the injury I had a song held by major labels for many weeks, when the song was not cut, I realized that maybe I had what it takes to get a record deal. I began talking to BrokenBowRecords who signed Craig Morgan and Jason Aldean, but was told that they couldn't sign me due to being under contract with the military. I was released from active duty on March 20, 2007 where I immediately left to be a DOD contractor in Iraq.  I spent the next 32 1/2 months in Iraq and went from being a mechanic for the Marine Corps to being the youngest safety officer in Iraq and part of the Senior Leadership Team. During that time In Iraq I recorded my album "My Car and My Guitar" flying back and fourth to nashville to do all the lyrics. It has gotten lots of attention over the years.</p>

      <p>In 2010 shortly after leaving Iraq I began having memory issues, where I couldn't remember my lyrics. So I have taken a long break from music. During that time I have worked numerous investigator, security, and law enforcement jobs.</p>
        
      

        <p>In 2018 I released my newest song "Hicks From The Sticks" which has gotten a lot of plays on Spotify and Itunes. </p>

          <p>In 2019 I heard about the UT Coding academy and I'm currently working on that certification. I look forward to making the next big app</p>
